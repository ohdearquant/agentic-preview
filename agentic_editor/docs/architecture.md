# Architecture

## Overview

The Aider FastAPI Service is designed to provide a RESTful API for executing the Aider tool within a virtual environment. The application is structured around FastAPI, a modern web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+.

## Components

### 1. FastAPI Application

- **Purpose**: Serves as the main entry point for the API.
- **Endpoints**: 
  - `/run-aider`: Executes the Aider tool with the provided configuration.

### 2. Virtual Environment Management

- **Purpose**: Ensures that the Aider tool runs in an isolated environment to avoid conflicts with other Python packages.
- **Functions**:
  - `create_venv`: Creates a new virtual environment if one does not exist.
  - `run_aider`: Installs the Aider tool and executes it within the virtual environment.

### 3. Aider Tool

- **Purpose**: Provides the core functionality for code editing and interaction.
- **Integration**: Installed and executed within the virtual environment.

## Data Flow

1. **Request Handling**: The FastAPI application receives a request at the `/run-aider` endpoint.
2. **Configuration Parsing**: The request body is parsed into an `AiderConfig` object.
3. **Environment Setup**: The application checks for an existing virtual environment or creates a new one.
4. **Aider Execution**: The Aider tool is installed and executed with the specified configuration.
5. **Response Streaming**: The output from the Aider tool is streamed back to the client.
