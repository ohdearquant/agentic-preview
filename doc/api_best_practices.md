# API Best Practices and Guidelines

Last updated: [Current Date]

This document outlines best practices and guidelines for developers using the Agentic Platform API. Following these recommendations will help ensure efficient and effective use of the API.

## General Guidelines

1. **Authentication**: Always keep your API keys secure and never share them publicly.

2. **Rate Limiting**: While we currently don't have rate limiting, be mindful of your API usage to prevent overloading the server.

3. **Error Handling**: Always implement proper error handling in your applications to gracefully manage API responses.

4. **Versioning**: Use the latest API version unless you have a specific reason to use an older one.

## Best Practices for Specific Endpoints

### Agentic Editor

1. **Run Aider**:
   - Provide clear and specific prompts for best results.
   - Include only relevant files in the `files` array to optimize performance.

### Agentic Preview

1. **Deploy Application**:
   - Ensure your repository is public or that you have the necessary permissions.
   - Use meaningful app names for easy management.

2. **Check Deployment Status**:
   - Implement a polling mechanism with appropriate intervals to check status.

3. **Stream Logs**:
   - Use server-sent events (SSE) capable clients for real-time log streaming.

### Project Management

1. **Create/Update Projects**:
   - Use descriptive names and detailed descriptions for better organization.
   - Keep repository URLs up-to-date.

### User Management

1. **Create/Update Users**:
   - Implement strong password policies on your end.
   - Validate email addresses before sending them to the API.

## Performance Optimization

1. **Minimize API Calls**: Batch operations when possible to reduce the number of API calls.

2. **Caching**: Implement caching mechanisms for frequently accessed, relatively static data.

3. **Pagination**: Use pagination for endpoints that return large datasets to improve response times.

## Security Considerations

1. **HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS for API communications to ensure data security.

2. **Input Validation**: Validate and sanitize all user inputs before sending them to the API.

3. **Output Encoding**: Properly encode any data received from the API before displaying it to users.

By following these best practices and guidelines, you'll be able to create more robust, efficient, and secure applications using the Agentic Platform API. Remember to check the main API documentation for specific details on endpoint usage and data formats.
